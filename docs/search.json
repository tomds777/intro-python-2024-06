    "text": "Course Objective\nData analysis plays a critical role in many academic disciplines, and the Python programming language has become one of the standard tools within the Data Science community. This course will introduce programming with Python and how to use it for data analysis. After successfully completing this course, you will be able to understand the fundamentals of the Python programming language. This skill set includes basic data analysis by data wrangling, data visualization, and implementing simple statistical models in Python.\nOur goal is to show you the scope of possibilities within Python and leave you with the impression that you can confidently implement your own empirical projects in Python."

Hence, we will cover the fundamentals of programming and Python, such as variables, loops, and logic statements, before we dive into the topic of Data Science. This course will not cover deeper statistical or theoretical concepts as we focus on applied coding.\nThis course introduces:\n\nSyntax and basics of Python\nHow to use Notebooks as a development environment\nData analysis, data wrangling, and data visualization using numpy, pandas and matplotlib\nIntroduction to implementing simple statistical models in Python with scikit-learn"

We aim to adhere to the following schedule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart\nContent\nDate\nTime\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nCourse Introduction and Case Study\n28.07.2023\n09:00 - 10:00\n\n\n\n2\nFundamentals of Python\n28.07.2023\n10:00 - 12:00\n\n\n\n3\nData wrangling and visualizations using pandas and matplotlib\n28.07.2023\n13:00 - 15:00\n\n\n\n4\nAdvanced visualizations with seaborn, modeling with scikit-learn\n28.07.2023\n15:00 - 17:00\n\n\n\n\nThere will be a lunch break after the second part of approximately 60 minutes and additional small breaks after each part.\nWe want you to make your hands dirty — that means we want you to code! Just following along fancy slides won’t magically transfer the skill of coding to you. But you actively engaging with the course content in your development environment will more likely do just that.\nThat’s why we need you to prepare accordingly: Please ensure that you have access to Google Colab before the course. We will use Google Colab for the coding parts, such that we can use Python without (sometimes time-consuming) pre-configuration or installation on your machine. To use Google colab, you need a Google account (same account which is used for Gmail, YouTube, etc.)\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to one of us through the e-mail addresses on the bottom of this page.\nITrainers\n\nFeel free to reach out to us by e-mail if you have any questions before, during, or after the course:\n\nThilo Kraft, Ph.D. Student in Quantitative Marketing, send me an email\nJan Bischoff, Course Designer and Teacher at TechAcademy e.V., Business and Economics Student, send me an email"
